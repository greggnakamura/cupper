My intention isn't to muddy the waters up so to speak

Collection of things I've come across

I've been a Web Developer for roughly 9 years, but only recently, within the past couple of years, have made the concerted effort to build with accessibility in mind (I know, sad right?)

My public title is Web Developer, but internally at my company I am a Web Developer / Accessibility Specialist. I introduced it to my company as part of our internal Evangelist program and Accessibility is now built into our process (which is frickin' awesome).
