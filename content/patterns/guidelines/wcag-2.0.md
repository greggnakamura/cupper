## Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0

In the Summer of 2018, WCAG 2.0 will be extended to WCAG 2.1. Until then, the current guidelines are WCAG 2.0


## Layers of Guidance
Several layers of guidance are provided by WCAG in order to help individuals and organizations meet varying needs. These layers are:

- **Principles**: 4 *principles* that provide the foundation for web accessibility: *perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust*
- **Guidelines**: Within the 4 *principles*, there are 12 non-testable *guidelines* the provide basic goals authors should follow
- **Success Criteria**: Each *guideline* contains testable success criteria, with 3 levels of conformance: **A, AA, AAA**
- **Sufficient and Advisory Techniques**: For each of the *guidelines* and *success criteria*, *techniques* are documented and fall into two categories: those that are *sufficient* for meeting the success criteria and those that are *advisory*. Advisory techniques are not required and allow authors to better address the guidelines.

## Overview of Principles and Guidelines
