I've been a Web Developer for almost a decade. Unfortunately, developing with Accessibility in mind hasn't always been a part of my process. This all changed about three years ago when I watched a <a href="https://webaim.org/intro/#video" target="_blank">video titled *"Keeping Web Accessibility in Mind"*<span class="vh">, opens in a new tab, window</span></a>, which provides and overview of some of the difficulties users with disabilities are faced with on the web today.

That video was a complete eye-opener for me. For years, I thought I was building and maintaining websites based on all the best practices available. I ticked all those boxes. HTML, CSS, and JS validation, *check*. Performance optimizations, *check*. Security, *check*.

What I didn't realize was that I was ignoring a substantial portion of my audience. <a href="https://www.powermapper.com/blog/website-accessibility-disability-statistics/" target="_blank">It is estimated that roughly 1 in 5 people have a disability<span class="vh">, opens in a new tab, window</span></a>...and this doesn't include age related (i.e. - vision) or temporary situations (i.e. - bright sunlight affecting screen visibility).

My public title is *Web Developer*, but at my company, <a href="http://wakefly.com" target="_blank">Wakefly<span class="vh">, opens in a new tab, window</span></a> I am a *Web Developer / Accessibility Specialist*. I introduced Accessibility to my company as part of our internal Evangelist program. As a result of this, accessibility is now built into our processes (which is frickin' awesome). There's still a long road ahead for us, but getting over that awareness barrier was huge.
