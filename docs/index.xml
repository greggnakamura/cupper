      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a Web Developer for almost a decade. Unfortunately, developing with Accessibility in mind hasn&amp;rsquo;t always been a part of my process. This all changed about three years ago when I watched a video titled &amp;ldquo;Keeping Web Accessibility in Mind&amp;rdquo;, opens in a new tab, window, which provides and overview of some of the difficulties users with disabilities are faced with on the web today.
That video was a complete eye-opener for me.</description>

      <description>You can just write markdown here. But don&amp;rsquo;t forget there are lots of shortcodes to help you with writing and showing off code too. See the documentation for Cupper for full details.
I can reference the pattern here.
   Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of a note shortcode for adding little &amp;ldquo;oh and also&amp;rdquo; notes to your patterns&amp;rsquo; documentation.
     This is a warning! It&amp;rsquo;s about something the reader should be careful to do or to avoid doing.</description>

      <description>If you were to disable images from loading on your website, would it still convey the same meaning?
  Images are a valuable source of information. As the saying goes, &amp;ldquo;a picture is worth a thousand words&amp;rdquo;. When coupled with content, images provide a way of conveying meaning through the use of visuals. However, sometimes people are not able to see these images. A few scenarios are:</description>

      <description>My intention isn&amp;rsquo;t to muddy the waters up so to speak
Collection of things I&amp;rsquo;ve come across
I&amp;rsquo;ve been a Web Developer for roughly 9 years, but only recently, within the past couple of years, have made the concerted effort to build with accessibility in mind (I know, sad right?)
My public title is Web Developer, but internally at my company I am a Web Developer / Accessibility Specialist. I introduced it to my company as part of our internal Evangelist program and Accessibility is now built into our process (which is frickin&amp;rsquo; awesome).</description>

      <description>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 In the Summer of 2018, WCAG 2.0 will be extended to WCAG 2.1. Until then, the current guidelines are WCAG 2.0
Layers of Guidance Several layers of guidance are provided by WCAG in order to help individuals and organizations meet varying needs. These layers are:
 Principles: 4 principles that provide the foundation for web accessibility: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust Guidelines: Within the 4 principles, there are 12 non-testable guidelines the provide basic goals authors should follow Success Criteria: Each guideline contains testable success criteria, with 3 levels of conformance: A, AA, AAA Sufficient and Advisory Techniques: For each of the guidelines and success criteria, techniques are documented and fall into two categories: those that are sufficient for meeting the success criteria and those that are advisory.</description>
