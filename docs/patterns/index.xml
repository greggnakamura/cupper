      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a Web Developer for almost a decade. Unfortunately, developing with Accessibility in mind hasn&amp;rsquo;t always been a part of my process. This all changed about three years ago when I watched a video titled &amp;ldquo;Keeping Web Accessibility in Mind&amp;rdquo;, opens in a new tab, window, which provides and overview of some of the difficulties users with disabilities are faced with on the web today.
That video was a complete eye-opener for me.</description>
