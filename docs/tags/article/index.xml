      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a Web Developer for almost a decade. Unfortunately, developing with Accessibility in mind hasn&amp;rsquo;t always been a part of my process. This all changed about three years ago when I watched a video titled &amp;ldquo;Keeping Web Accessibility in Mind&amp;rdquo;, opens in a new tab, window, which provides and overview of some of the difficulties users with disabilities are faced with on the web today.
That video was a complete eye-opener for me.</description>

      <description>My intention isn&amp;rsquo;t to muddy the waters up so to speak
Collection of things I&amp;rsquo;ve come across
I&amp;rsquo;ve been a Web Developer for roughly 9 years, but only recently, within the past couple of years, have made the concerted effort to build with accessibility in mind (I know, sad right?)
My public title is Web Developer, but internally at my company I am a Web Developer / Accessibility Specialist. I introduced it to my company as part of our internal Evangelist program and Accessibility is now built into our process (which is frickin&amp;rsquo; awesome).</description>
